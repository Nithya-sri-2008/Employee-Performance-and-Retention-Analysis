### Final Report: Employee Performance and Retention Analysis
### Submission date[25|08|2025]
### 1. Introduction

The objective of this analysis was to explore employee performance and attrition trends within the organization. Using data analytics and machine learning models, we identified key factors influencing employee performance, evaluated attrition risk across departments, and proposed strategies to improve retention .

### 2. Data Overview

Dataset: 100 employees, 6 key features (Age, Department, Salary, Years at Company, Performance Score, Attrition).

### Methods Used:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual trends (line plots, scatter plots, bar charts).

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest Classifier (for attrition prediction), Linear Regression (for performance prediction), Neural Network (for performance scoring).

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, R², MSE.

### 3. Key Findings
### Employee Performance

~ Salary and Years at Company strongly influence performance scores.

~ Engineering employees consistently score higher, while Sales and HR show more variable performance.

~ Longer-tenured employees tend to have stable, higher performance.

### Employee Attrition

High-Risk Groups:

Sales and Marketing departments report higher attrition rates.

Mid-level performers show a higher chance of attrition may be due to lack of recognition.

### Model Performance

Attrition Prediction (Random Forest Classifier): Accuracy ~60%, F1-score ~0.46 → Indicates moderate predictive power,.

Performance Prediction (Linear Regression): R² ~0.79, MSE ~10.4 → Model explains ~79% of performance variation.

Neural Network (Performance Prediction): Showed ability to capture non-linear relationships; training and validation losses decreased across epochs.

### 4. Recommendations
### Performance Improvement

Implement targeted training programs in Sales/Marketing.

Establish mentorship initiatives in Engineering to sustain high performance.


### 5. Conclusion

This analysis highlights that employee performance and retention are strongly influenced by salary, experience, department. By strategically focusing on high-risk departments (Sales/Marketing) and employee groups (young employees, mid-level performers), the organization can:

Improve employee satisfaction,

Reduce attrition rates.
